# kPow for Apache Kafka

[kPow](https://kpow.io) - The Ultimate Engineering Toolkit for [Apache KafkaÂ®](http://kafka.apache.org/)

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release information or [our blog](https://kpow.io/category/releases/) for full notes on each release and JAR artefacts.

Kpow is an Enterprise-grade toolkit for engineers working with Apache Kafka that:

* Ships as a single docker-container or JAR file
* You deploy and secure like any other Enterprise web-application
* Runs air-gapped with all information stored within your Kafka cluster(s)
* Is trusted by the world's largest companies, from publishing to payments networks
* Has a simple, transparent pricing structure
* Is built and supported by an engineering-lead team deeply experienced in Kafka delivery

The kPow image is available directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/operatr/kpow). Images are built using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/operatr-io/kpow/actions/workflows/build.yml).
